      Today, I will talk about personality. I believe that a person’s personality can change depending on their environment and experiences. I used to be an introverted person, and I was not good at large social situations. However, after joining a club at university, I became a little more extroverted. In the club, I had many chances to communicate through live performances. At first, I was very nervous, but little by little I got used to it and became more confident. From this experience, I learned that personality can change through experience.</p>
