      The article I chose is about Christmas events in Tokyo. I became interested in it because I actually visited the Christmas market at Meiji Jingu last week. Christmas markets originated in Germany, and the event was filled with stalls selling wine, sausages, beer, and many other treats. I cannot drink alcohol yet, so I enjoyed spiral sausages and hot drinks instead. They were a little expensive, but very authentic and delicious. There were also beautiful illuminations and shops selling Christmas ornaments imported from Germany. I really enjoyed the German-style holiday atmosphere, and I highly recommend visiting.
