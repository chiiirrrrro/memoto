      The article I chose is about the illumination event at Ashikaga Flower Park. The park’s winter show, called “Flower Fantasy,” features about five million LED lights and creates a stunning nighttime landscape. I found this article especially interesting because the park is very familiar to me. I went to a high school near the park, and I could see the beautiful lights from campus every night. Seeing a place from my hometown introduced in an international article makes me feel proud, and it reminds me how special the area is to me.
