      Today, Iâ€™d like to talk about my brother. He is six years younger than me and now in the second year of junior high school. He has two great qualities. First, he is very good at sports. He belongs to the track and field club at school and also joins a local team. He got third place in the prefectural competition this year. Second, he is very popular and trusted by his friends. He was even elected as the student council president. Iâ€™m really proud of him and excited about his future.
