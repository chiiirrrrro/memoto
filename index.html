      I would like to talk about China’s environmental policy. In China, the market for electric cars is growing quickly. This is because the government gives support such as subsidies and lower taxes to help people buy electric cars. Recently, very small and cheap electric cars have also become popular. However, these low-cost cars often have problems. Their driving range is short and the batteries do not last very long. As the market becomes bigger,companies compete to make their cars even cheaper. Because of this, some cars may become less safe or lower in quality.
